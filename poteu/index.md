**Privacy Policy**

**Last Updated:** July 20, 2025

**1. Introduction**
This Privacy Policy outlines the practices for applications developed by **b8o** (the “Developer”). This policy applies to all applications published by the Developer, including but not limited to “ПОТЭЭ-903н-2022”, “782н”, “ФЗ-116: Промбез офлайн”,“ ППР 1479: Правила пож.режима”, and “ПТЭЭП 2025 • Электроустановки” (collectively, the “App” or “Apps”). The Developer is committed to protecting your privacy.

**2. Disclaimer and Source of Information**
It is crucial to understand the following:
*   **This App Does Not Represent a Government Entity.** It has no affiliation with any government body of the Russian Federation or any other country and is not authorized to facilitate government services.
*   **This is Not an Official Source.** The information provided within each App is based on publicly available regulations but is not an official publication and may contain inaccuracies or outdated content.
*   **Educational Purpose Only.** The Apps are designed solely as supplementary tools for studying the relevant regulations and standards. For legally binding purposes, always refer to official sources and publications.

**3. Data Collection and Usage**

**3.1. Data Stored Locally on Your Device**
The App stores certain data **exclusively on your device's internal storage** to save your preferences and progress. This includes settings like your chosen theme, font size, bookmarks, or notes. This data is never transmitted to the Developer or any third party and is fully under your control.

**3.2. Third-Party Services: Crash Reporting with Sentry**
To improve the stability and performance of our Apps, we use a third-party service for error and crash monitoring called **Sentry** (provided by Functional Software, Inc.). This is the only third-party service used in the App.

*   **Purpose:** Sentry helps us diagnose and fix technical problems in real-time. When the App crashes or encounters an error, Sentry automatically collects diagnostic data.
*   **Data Collected:** The information sent to Sentry is strictly for technical diagnostics and may include crash logs, device information (such as model, OS version, and orientation), and any other relevant data.
*   **Data Usage:** This data is used exclusively to identify the cause of the error and improve the App's stability. We do not use this information to personally identify you.

For more details on how Sentry handles data, you can review **Sentry's Privacy Policy** here: [https://sentry.io/privacy/](https://sentry.io/privacy/)

**4. Your Rights and Data Control**
You have full control over the data stored locally on your device. You can delete this data at any time by:
1.  **Clearing App Data:** Go to your Android “Settings,” navigate to “Apps,” select the specific application you have installed (e.g., "ПОТЭЭ-903н-2022"), and use the “Clear Cache” and “Clear Data” options.
2.  **Uninstalling the App:** Uninstalling the application from your device will permanently delete all of its associated data.

Data collected by Sentry for crash reporting is handled according to their data retention policies.

**5. Security**
We are committed to ensuring the app is secure. If you discover any security vulnerability, please contact me via email. I am committed to promptly addressing and resolving any concerns.

**6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
